# SwagLabs eCommerce Website Automation

This repository contains automated tests for the SwagLabs e-commerce website using Playwright and TypeScript. This test follows a Page Object Model (POM) where objects for each pages are created and tests are written based on the pages actions.

   ```
2. Run the tests:

```shell
npx playwright test --ui
```

## Tests

The tests can be found in the `tests` directory. The tests cover the following scenarios:

1. **Login Tests**

   * **Filter Products by Price - Low to High** : Tests the functionality of filtering products by price from low to high. Checks if the products are sorted in ascending order of their prices by comparing the prices.
3. **Checkout Tests**
